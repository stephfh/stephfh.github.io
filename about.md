## Moin! Servus! Hi! Hello! ðŸ‘‹

* I'm *currentYear - 1990* years old.
* I'm a web developer, focusing on the frontend side of things.
* I have knack for all things DevOps.
* I'm European ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º, currently living in the vibrant city of Cologne.
* I love languages and I speak a few.
* Bouldering is a passion ...
* ... as is skating.
* Python was the first language I learnt, PHP the second (aside from HTML and CSS, which goes without saying).
* I still use PHP today. There, I said it.
